## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Each component is built and tested individually
2. **Parallel Systems**: Maintain compatibility with existing systems during transition
3. **Feature Toggles**: Use flags to switch between old and new systems
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration testing

### Migration Path
1. **New Features**: Build using new architecture from the start
2. **Critical Systems**: Prioritize fixing issues in train/voxel system
3. **Gradual Conversion**: Move one system at a time to new architecture
4. **Legacy Support**: Maintain compatibility layers where needed

## Engine/Game Code Separation

In addition to implementing the scene graph, we will restructure the codebase to separate engine code from game-specific code:

### New Directory Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ engine/                      # Engine-level components (reusable)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/                    # Core framework

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ systems/                 # Game-specific systems

    â”œâ”€â”€ TimeControlsUI.ts        # Time controls
    â””â”€â”€ TrainUI.ts               # Train interface
```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Create New Structure**: Establish the new directory structure
2. **Move Engine Components**: Start by moving core engine components
3. **Update Imports**: Fix import references as files are moved
4. **Move Game Components**: Then move game-specific components
5. **Incremental Testing**: Test after each component is moved

## Technical Debt Management

During this refactoring, we'll address these existing issues:

1. **Coordinate System Inconsistencies**: Standardize on right-handed coordinates
2. **Manual Position Calculations**: Remove error-prone manual transformations
3. **Memory Management**: Fix potential leaks in render resource handling
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Address individual mesh creation overhead
5. **Code Organization**: Separate engine and game concerns for better maintainability
6. **Interface Definitions**: Create clear interfaces between engine and game code

## Success Metrics

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. **Visual Correctness**: Voxel rotations properly follow parent objects
2. **Performance Improvement**: 30%+ increase in FPS with large scenes
3. **Code Maintainability**: Reduced complexity in spatial transformation code
4. **Feature Enablement**: New capabilities like LOD and instancing are working
5. **Code Separation**: Clean boundaries between engine and game code
6. **Reusability**: Engine components can be reused in different game contexts

- âœ… Reduced compilation errors from 350+ to 50 errors (90% reduction!)
- ðŸ”„ Fixing remaining component usage patterns (getComponent string vs class usage)
- ðŸ”„ Updating test files with outdated API expectations
- ðŸ”„ Resolving remaining type compatibility issues

### Progress on Import Migration:
- Round 1: Updated 20 files with basic import patterns
- Round 2: Updated 21 additional files with remaining patterns  
- **Success**: Reduced compilation errors from 350+ to 50 (90% improvement!)

  - Component usage patterns in TrainCarVoxel.ts (23 errors)
  - API method mismatches in a few places (EventStack, train methods)
  - Test file expectations that need updating
  - Minor Babylon.js API compatibility issues

### Next Steps:
1. Complete import path updates across all files
2. Update all entities to use new engine imports
3. Update all components to use new engine imports
4. Update all UI files to use new imports
5. Implement TrainCar and TrainCarVoxel refactoring to use SceneNodeComponent
6. Integrate SceneNodeDebugger with SceneManager
