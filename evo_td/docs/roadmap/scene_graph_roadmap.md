## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Each component is built and tested individually
2. **Parallel Systems**: Maintain compatibility with existing systems during transition
3. **Feature Toggles**: Use flags to switch between old and new systems
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive unit and integration testing

### Migration Path
1. **New Features**: Build using new architecture from the start
2. **Critical Systems**: Prioritize fixing issues in train/voxel system
3. **Gradual Conversion**: Move one system at a time to new architecture
4. **Legacy Support**: Maintain compatibility layers where needed

## Engine/Game Code Separation

In addition to implementing the scene graph, we will restructure the codebase to separate engine code from game-specific code:

### New Directory Structure

```

    â””â”€â”€ TrainUI.ts               # Train interface
```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Create New Structure**: Establish the new directory structure
2. **Move Engine Components**: Start by moving core engine components
3. **Update Imports**: Fix import references as files are moved
4. **Move Game Components**: Then move game-specific components
5. **Incremental Testing**: Test after each component is moved

## Technical Debt Management

During this refactoring, we'll address these existing issues:

1. **Coordinate System Inconsistencies**: Standardize on right-handed coordinates
2. **Manual Position Calculations**: Remove error-prone manual transformations
3. **Memory Management**: Fix potential leaks in render resource handling
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Address individual mesh creation overhead
5. **Code Organization**: Separate engine and game concerns for better maintainability
6. **Interface Definitions**: Create clear interfaces between engine and game code

## Success Metrics

The refactoring will be considered successful when:

1. **Visual Correctness**: Voxel rotations properly follow parent objects
2. **Performance Improvement**: 30%+ increase in FPS with large scenes
3. **Code Maintainability**: Reduced complexity in spatial transformation code
4. **Feature Enablement**: New capabilities like LOD and instancing are working
5. **Code Separation**: Clean boundaries between engine and game code
6. **Reusability**: Engine components can be reused in different game contexts

- **Success**: Reduced compilation errors from 350+ to 50 (90% improvement!)
- **Core Achievement**: All main import path issues resolved
- Main remaining issues are now functional/behavioral, not structural:
  - Component usage patterns in TrainCarVoxel.ts (23 errors)
  - API method mismatches in a few places (EventStack, train methods)
  - Test file expectations that need updating
  - Minor Babylon.js API compatibility issues

### Next Critical Steps (Updated Priority):

#### ðŸš¨ **Phase A: Scene Graph Event System (High Priority)**
Our current ComponentEvents system lacks scene graph awareness. We need:
1. **Hierarchical Event Propagation**: Events that bubble up/down the scene graph
2. **Spatial Event Filtering**: Events can target by proximity or hierarchy level
3. **Event Phases**: Capture and bubble phases like DOM events
4. **Scene Context**: Events include spatial and hierarchical context

#### ðŸ”„ **Phase B: Entity Integration with SceneGraph (Critical)**
Major entities need to be converted to use SceneNodeComponent:
1. **TrainCar Integration**: Cars become children of Train scene node
2. **TrainCarVoxel Integration**: Voxels become children of Car scene nodes  
3. **Attachment System**: Attachments use scene hierarchy for proper mounting
4. **Enemy Integration**: Enemies use scene graph for spatial relationships

#### ðŸ’¡ **Phase C: Spatial Systems Enhancement**
Implement generic spatial components for collision and interaction:
1. **RadiusComponent**: Generic spatial component for collision/proximity/LOD
2. **Collision Detection**: Leverage scene graph for efficient spatial queries
3. **Proximity Systems**: AI awareness, interaction zones, trigger areas
4. **LOD Implementation**: Distance-based optimization using scene hierarchy

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Phase D: Rendering Optimization**
1. **Automatic Transform Sync**: Render components follow scene node transforms
2. **Frustum Culling**: Scene graph-aware visibility determination
3. **Batching**: Group similar objects in scene hierarchy for performance

## SceneManager Integration Plan

### Current Status

The `SceneManager` class is currently the bridge between our game objects and the rendering system, but it doesn't fully leverage our new scene graph architecture. Here's what needs to be updated:

### 1. Visual Registration Refactoring

```typescript
// CURRENT APPROACH - Direct mesh registration
this.sceneManager.registerGameObject(rail, railMesh);

// NEW APPROACH - Scene graph aware registration
this.sceneManager.registerSceneNode(rail.getComponent('sceneNode'), railVisualMesh);
```

### 2. Hierarchical Registration

```typescript
// Current approach - Flat registration
this.sceneManager.registerGameObject(train, trainMesh);
this.sceneManager.registerGameObject(trainCar1, car1Mesh);
this.sceneManager.registerGameObject(trainCar2, car2Mesh);

// New approach - Hierarchical registration
this.sceneManager.registerHierarchy(train);
// Child objects auto-registered through scene graph
```

### 3. Transform Propagation

Currently, the `SceneManager` manually updates positions:

```typescript
// Current approach
const posComponent = mapping.gameObject.getComponent<PositionComponent>("position");
if (posComponent) {
    const pos = posComponent.getPosition();
    visual.position.x = pos.x;
    visual.position.y = pos.y;
    visual.position.z = pos.z;
}
```

New approach will leverage SceneNodeComponent's built-in transform hierarchy:

```typescript
// New approach - transforms propagate automatically through the scene graph
// SceneManager just ensures the root nodes have correct transforms
const sceneNode = mapping.gameObject.getComponent<SceneNodeComponent>("sceneNode");
if (sceneNode && sceneNode.hasChanged()) {
    sceneNode.syncTransformToNode();
}
```

### Implementation Steps

1. Add new methods to SceneManager:
   - `registerSceneNode(sceneNode: SceneNodeComponent, visual?: AbstractMesh): void`
   - `registerHierarchy(rootGameObject: GameObject): void`
   - `unregisterHierarchy(rootGameObjectId: string): void`

2. Update existing visual mappings to track SceneNodeComponent references

3. Modify the update logic to work with the scene graph:
   - Only update root nodes, let transforms propagate naturally
   - Leverage SceneNodeComponent for visibility culling

4. Connect SceneManager to SceneGraphEventSystem for automatic updates

5. Fix specific entity registration in the main app:
   - Update Train, TrainCar, Rail, Station registrations
   - Ensure proper parent-child relationships
