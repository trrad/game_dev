# Scene Graph Refactor: Current Status and Next Steps

## Additional Implementation Notes (2025-07-03)

- **TrainCar Rail Attachment**: Train cars are positioned using two ‚Äúwheel‚Äù points (front and back) that slide along the rail spline. This enables realistic coupling and orientation, as each car‚Äôs transform is determined by the positions of its two wheel points on the rail.
- **Scene Graph Root**: There is a single global root node (managed by SceneManager) for all NodeObjects. All events propagate through this root using the hierarchical event system. The legacy EventStack is deprecated in favor of this unified system.
- **Per-Voxel Objects**: Voxels are individual NodeObjects (not thin instances), supporting per-voxel logic, events, and attachments. Mesh merging is used for rendering optimization, but the logical node structure is preserved for gameplay and event handling.
- **Instancing for Projectiles/Background**: Instancing/thin instances are reserved for projectiles or background visuals, not for core game objects like voxels.
- **Mesh Merging**: For static or rarely-changing voxel structures (e.g., a train car), mesh merging is used to reduce draw calls, but logical node structure is maintained for game logic and events.

## SceneManager Integration Issues

### Current Status

The current `SceneManager` class has not been fully adapted to work with our new scene graph architecture:

1. **Visual Registration**: Still uses a direct mapping between GameObjects and Meshes/TransformNodes
2. **No NodeComponent
 Awareness**: Not taking advantage of the hierarchical capabilities
3. **Manual Position Syncing**: Still manually syncing positions from PositionComponent to visuals
4. **Missing Event System**: Not integrated with the new SceneGraphEventSystem
5. **No Hierarchy Management**: Doesn't properly establish parent-child relationships

### Required Changes

1. **Visual Registration Refactoring**: 
   - Update registration to use NodeComponent
   
   - Leverage the natural hierarchy in NodeComponent
   
   - Support automatic parent-child relationships

2. **Position Syncing**:
   - Use NodeComponent
   's position/rotation/scale
   - Eliminate the need for manual sync from PositionComponent

3. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Support proper parent-child relationships
   - Allow transforms to cascade through the hierarchy

4. **Event Integration**:
   - Connect SceneManager events to SceneGraphEventSystem
   - Allow scene graph events to trigger rendering updates

### Main Game Entity Integration Priorities

1. **Train System**:
   - Convert Train to a parent node with TrainCars as children
   - TrainCars should have TrainCarVoxels as children (each voxel remains an individual mesh/object for easy modification and per-voxel logic)
   - Voxels should have Attachments as children
   - Note: Mesh merging or shader-based batching is not used by default, but may be considered later if performance becomes a concern.

2. **Enemy System**:
   - Convert Enemy entities to use scene graph
   - Enable proximity detection via RadiusComponent

3. **Station and Rail System**:
   - Update to use scene graph for positioning
   - Connect to Event System for interactions

## Updated Status and Next Steps (Priority Order)

### üéØ Phase 1: SceneManager Integration (1-2 days) **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
1. **SceneManager Refactoring**: Update to use NodeComponent
 instead of direct mesh registration
2. **Hierarchical Object Registration**: Implement proper child-parent registration in SceneManager
3. **Rendering Integration**: Ensure NodeComponent
 properly synchronizes with rendering system
4. **Event System Integration**: Connect SceneManager with SceneGraphEventSystem

### üéØ Phase 2: Entity Integration (2-3 days) **HIGH PRIORITY**
1. **TrainCar ‚Üí NodeComponent
**: Convert train cars to use scene hierarchy
2. **TrainCarVoxel ‚Üí NodeComponent

4. **Debug Tools**: Integrate SceneNodeDebugger with new event system

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. SceneManager Integration

1. **Modify SceneManager**:
   - Add new registration methods for scene nodes and hierarchies
   - Update visual mappings to include NodeComponent
    references
   - Modify update methods to work with scene graph
   - Connect to SceneGraphEventSystem

2. **Core Class Modifications**:
   - `SceneManager.ts` - Update to be scene graph aware
   - `ecs-app.ts` - Update entity registration to use new methods
   - `RenderComponent.ts` - Ensure proper integration with NodeComponent
   

### 2. Entity Integration

1. **Train Integration**:
   - Update `Train.ts` to fully use NodeComponent
    for positioning
   - Establish parent-child relationship between Train and TrainCars

2. **TrainCar Integration**:
   - Complete `TrainCar.ts` integration with NodeComponent
   
   - Fix TrainCar positioning on rails
   - Establish proper parent-child relationships with TrainCarVoxels

3. **TrainCarVoxel Integration**:
   - Ensure `TrainCarVoxel.ts` fully utilizes scene graph
   - Fix local/world position calculations
   - Connect attachment slots to scene graph

### Implementation Strategy

1. Start with the SceneManager modifications - this is the core integration point
2. Then update the Train entity hierarchy as a concrete implementation example
3. Test each step with manual interactions in the game
4. Fix edge cases and ensure compatibility with existing systems

### Success Criteria

1. Train components position correctly based on scene graph hierarchy
2. Transforms correctly propagate from parent to child nodes
3. Scene graph events properly bubble/capture through the hierarchy
4. Spatial events work correctly with RadiusComponents

## Example Usage (Now Working!)

### Hierarchical Train Communication
```typescript
// Engine car broadcasts power change to all sibling cars
engineCar.emitToSiblings('power:changed', { newPower: 150, efficiency: 0.8 });

// Individual car reports damage to parent train
car.emitToParent('car:damaged', { 
    carId: car.id, 
    damage: 50, 
    healthRemaining: 25 
});
```

### Spatial Enemy Detection  
```typescript
// Enemy detects all trains within 15 unit radius
enemyDetectionRadius.emitToRadius('proximity:check', {
    source: enemy,
    timestamp: Date.now()
}, { radiusType: 'interaction', excludeSelf: true });
```

### Area of Effect Damage
```typescript
// Explosion affects all entities within 15 units
SceneEvents.emitToRadius('explosion', {
    damage: 100,
    center: explosionCenter
}, explosionCenter, 15, (node) => 
    node.gameObject?.getComponent('radius') !== undefined
);
```

## Success Metrics

When completed, we should have:
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical Event System**: Events propagate properly through scene graph
- ‚úÖ **Visual Correctness**: Voxel rotations follow parent transformations correctly
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: 30%+ FPS improvement with proper culling/LOD
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Clean separation between engine/game code
- ‚úÖ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new spatial components and behaviors

Would you like me to start with the Scene Graph Event System implementation, or would you prefer to tackle the remaining compilation errors first?
