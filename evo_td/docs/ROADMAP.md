# Development Roadmap

## Current Status

The Train Trading Game has a solid ECS foundation with basic train movement, enemy combat, and 3D voxel rendering. The codebase has been recently refactored for consistency and maintainability, with clean separation between game logic and rendering systems.

### What's Working (Descriptive)
- **Core ECS Architecture**: GameObject base class with component system
- **Train System**: Multi-car trains with voxel-based construction
- **Enemy System**: Dynamic spawning, AI behaviors, and combat mechanics
- **3D Rendering**: Babylon.js integration with component-based rendering
- **Attachment System**: Weapons and equipment mounting on train cars
- **Station Network**: Basic trade stations with procedural placement
- **UI Framework**: Responsive interface with touch support
- **Logging & Observability**: Comprehensive debugging and metrics

### Recent Improvements
- ✅ **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Removed deprecated rendering systems and duplicate components
- ✅ **Naming Standardization**: Consistent method patterns and component naming
- ✅ **Utility Consolidation**: `MathUtils` and `GeometryUtils` for common operations
- ✅ **Architecture Documentation**: Clear separation of concerns and design patterns
