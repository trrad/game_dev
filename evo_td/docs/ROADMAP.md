- **SceneNodeComponent**: Core component for hierarchical transformations
- **SceneGraphEventSystem**: Advanced event propagation with bubbling and capturing phases
- **RadiusComponent**: Spatial operations for collision, proximity, and LOD systems
- **Train System**: Multi-car trains with voxel-based construction
- **Enemy System**: Dynamic spawning, AI behaviors, and combat mechanics
- **3D Rendering**: Babylon.js integration with component-based rendering
- **Attachment System**: Weapons and equipment mounting on train cars
- **Station Network**: Basic trade stations with procedural placement
- **UI Framework**: Responsive interface with touch support
- **Logging & Observability**: Comprehensive debugging and metrics

### Recent Improvements
