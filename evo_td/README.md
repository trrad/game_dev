# Scene Graph Train Trading Game

A hierarchical scene graph-based train trading game built with TypeScript and Babylon.js. Features trains that move along rails with modular voxel-based construction, cargo trading mechanics, and combat against enemies. Originally built with ECS architecture, now enhanced with a robust scene graph hierarchy.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```
