# ECS Train Trading Game

An Entity-Component-System (ECS) based train trading game built with TypeScript. Features trains that move along rails, carry cargo, and engage in trading mechanics while defending against enemies.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```
