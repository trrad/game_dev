# Development Tools and Patterns

This directory contains tools, scripts, and patterns used for development workflows in the Train Trading Game project.

## Scripts for Batch Operations

### Import Path Migration Scripts

These PowerShell scripts were used during the engine/game directory restructure to systematically update import paths across the codebase:

- `batch_import_updater.ps1` - Core script for bulk import path updates
- `batch_import_updater_round2.ps1` - Extended script for additional patterns

These scripts demonstrate a pattern for:
- **Systematic refactoring**: Handling large-scale code changes across many files
- **Risk reduction**: Using scripts to ensure consistent changes rather than manual edits
- **Progress tracking**: Showing which files were modified during the operation
- **Pattern matching**: Using regex to find and replace complex import patterns

### Usage Pattern for Future Refactoring

When doing large-scale code changes:

1. **Identify the patterns** - What needs to change across many files?
2. **Create a mapping** - Define the oldâ†’new transformations
3. **Test on a small subset** - Run the script on a few files first
4. **Run with progress tracking** - Use the full script with progress indication
5. **Validate results** - Check that the changes were applied correctly
6. **Commit incrementally** - Commit the script results as a logical unit

### Key Script Features

- **Progress indication** with `Write-Progress`
- **Selective file filtering** to avoid node_modules, build artifacts, etc.
- **Change tracking** to report how many files were modified
- **Error handling** with try/catch blocks
- **Multiple pattern support** for comprehensive updates

This pattern can be adapted for:
- Renaming classes or interfaces
- Updating API calls
- Changing configuration formats
- Migrating to new libraries
- Refactoring component architectures

## AI Agent Development Notes

These scripts represent a best practice for **AI-assisted large-scale refactoring**:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI identifies the patterns, human reviews and approves the approach
2. **Tooling-first approach**: Use scripts rather than manual file-by-file edits
3. **Incremental validation**: Check progress at each step rather than doing everything at once
4. **Documentation**: Keep examples of successful patterns for future use

The import migration reduced compilation errors from 350+ to 50 (90% improvement) in two script runs, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.
